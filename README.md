# Grammar Correction

## Overview

 The purpose of this project was to develop and evaluate models for automated grammar correction using various NLP techniques and machine learning models. The primary models used were BART (a transformer-based model) and a custom-built LSTM network. The data for training and evaluation consisted of sentences with grammatical errors labeled alongside their corrected versions. Additionally, each error was categorized by type, enabling a detailed analysis of error prevalence and model performance across different error types.
